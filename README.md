I'm a Software Engineering student at Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·. I'm passionated about free and open source and always learning new stuff! 

Some of the technologies that I use are Go, C, Rust and MySQL, among some others.

I'm currently working as a backend developer and I'm also a teaching assistant in university.
